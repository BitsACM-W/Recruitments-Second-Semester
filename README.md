# Second semester recruitments for ACM-W :rocket:
### Tasks evaluation: 
1) Code readability
2) Originality
3) Extent of implementation
4) What you learnt while doing (most important)
5) You can choose any one task and do it either individually or in a team. We will be announcing the teams soon. Those with similar interests will be grouped together. The deadline is 22 April, 5pm. We will be circulating a google form where you have to share the repository link and the details of your tasks and the team. 
6) Add a README file to your repository and add pictures /video of your task and how you implemented the same. 

P.S. You need get acquainted with the use of GitHub now - https://towardsdatascience.com/github-primer-for-dummies-e8d307e52b6d. Check this out on how to get started!

We recommend you try new things and do the tasks on your own. This is a great learning opportunity for each one of you, but do ask in case you feel stuck or encounter any problems. All the best :)

### Good Luck!
